## FAQ

### 1. How do I know if my dog has a food allergy or a sensitive stomach?
The symptoms of food allergies and sensitive stomachs can be similar, but there are some key differences. Food allergies often cause skin irritation, such as rashes or itching, while a sensitive stomach typically leads to digestive issues like vomiting, diarrhea, and gas. Consulting your veterinarian can help determine the underlying cause and guide you to the appropriate dietary solutions.

### 2. Can I switch my dog's food gradually to help with a sensitive stomach?
Yes, gradually transitioning your dog to a new food is crucial for sensitive stomachs. Over the course of 7-10 days, slowly mix the new food with the old, increasing the ratio of new to old until your dog is fully transitioned. This gradual approach helps minimize digestive upset and allows your dog's system to adjust to the new formula.

### 3. Are there any natural remedies I can give my dog for a sensitive stomach?
In addition to a high-quality, sensitive stomach-friendly dog food, some natural remedies that may provide relief include:
- Probiotics to support gut health
- Digestive enzymes to aid in nutrient absorption
- Ginger or peppermint oil to soothe the digestive tract
- Slippery elm to coat and protect the esophagus and stomach

Always consult your veterinarian before introducing any new supplements or remedies to your dog's diet.

Remember, addressing your dog's sensitive stomach requires a multifaceted approach, combining the right diet, feeding practices, and potentially supplementation. With patience and the guidance of your veterinarian, you can help your furry friend find the relief and nourishment they need.
