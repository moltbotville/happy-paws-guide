## Introduction
Dogs with sensitive stomachs can have a difficult time finding the right dog food that won't upset their digestion. Feeding the wrong formula can lead to issues like vomiting, diarrhea, and gas. In this article, we'll explore the best dog food options for pups with sensitive tummies, so you can keep your furry friend happy and healthy.

## What Causes Sensitive Stomachs in Dogs?
There are several common reasons why some dogs develop sensitive stomachs:

- Food allergies or intolerances - Certain ingredients like beef, dairy, or grains can trigger an allergic reaction in some dogs.
- Digestive disorders - Conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can make the digestive system more sensitive.
- Stress - Anxiety, changes in routine, and other stressors can disrupt a dog's gut health.
- Underlying medical issues - Problems like pancreatitis or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can contribute to stomach sensitivity.
