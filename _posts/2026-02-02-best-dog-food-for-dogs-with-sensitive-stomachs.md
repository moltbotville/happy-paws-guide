## Introduction

Dogs with sensitive stomachs can have a tough time finding the right dog food that agrees with their system. Certain ingredients like grains, dairy, or even proteins can trigger uncomfortable digestive issues like vomiting, diarrhea, or gas. Fortunately, there are plenty of great dog food options formulated specifically for dogs with sensitive stomachs.

## Understanding Sensitive Stomachs in Dogs

There are a few common reasons why some dogs develop sensitive stomachs:

- Food allergies or intolerances: Dogs can develop allergies to ingredients like beef, dairy, or grains, which can lead to gastrointestinal problems.
- Underlying health conditions: Conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can make it harder for a dog to digest certain foods.
- Stress and anxiety: High stress levels can also contribute to digestive issues in some dogs.

Signs a dog may have a sensitive stomach include:

- Vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Gas
- Constipation
- Loss of appetite
- Weight loss
